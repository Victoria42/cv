          <p> I am an aspiring Full-Stack Software Engineer. I just recently switched my major from Biology to Computer Science. I don't want to pursue Dental Assisting or Dental Hygiene anymore. I feel like I had a sudden epiphany and immediately wanted to change my career path. I just recently became a mother to my baby boy Henry who was born on May 20, 2022 and feel as though I could better financially support him if I pursued Software Engineering as it has always been an interest of mine. </p></td>
